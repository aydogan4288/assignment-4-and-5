1. Which class would you use to store your birthday in years, months, days, seconds, and nanoseconds?
A - LocalDateTime or ZonedDateTime.
 

2. What is the difference between a ZoneId and a ZoneOffset?
A - Both ZoneId and ZoneOffset track an offset from Greenwich/UTC time, but the ZoneOffset class tracks only the 
absolute offset from Greenwich/UTC. The ZoneId class also uses the ZoneRules to determine how an offset varies for
a particular time of year and region.
